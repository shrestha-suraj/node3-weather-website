## Demo WebApp

## Description
This weather web application demonstrates my understanding of RESTful API and Server Side Web Rendering. The application is simple and makes two API calls to the darksky and mapbox API. The mapbox API is used to analyze the user input text to get a geolocation code (latitude and longitude). The other api call takes in this coordinates and gets various weather information about the location form which we filter out the tempreature.
